# Master thesis project
This project focuses on modeling nutrient balance (Nitrogen and Phosphorus) within an Integrated Rice and Fish Farming System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. The goal is to understand the dynamics of nutrient accumulation and availability for rice plants in this sustainable agricultural system.

Project Overview

Objective: To develop a modular and scalable model to simulate the nutrient flows and balance in a rice-fish integrated system, with a focus on Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) accumulation.

Scope:
Identify key components influencing nutrient dynamics (e.g., fish excretion, soil uptake, plant absorption).
Use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to structure the model for modularity and clarity.
Analyze nutrient availability for rice plants over time.
